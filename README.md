### How it works

This application sends messages to a list of contacts, for example employees, to notify them quickly of critical business information. <br />
With few clicks the administrator (CHAMPION) can initiate a call tree and collect statistical information such as overall
response time between outbound and inbound sms, % of replies within X minutes, also detailed stats for each recipient.
